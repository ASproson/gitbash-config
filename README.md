Replace git-prompt.sh in the above file path with the attached file to remove MINGW64 and any system denotation from GitBash, also changes the username reference to green and any directories to purple

Note line 15:

> 	PS1="$PS1"' atlas '             # user@host<space>
  
  Feel free to replace atlas with your chosen name, this overwrites any C: username within GitBash
